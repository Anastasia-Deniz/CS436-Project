# CS436-Project
The StudyCafe project aims to create a cloud-based, gamified study tracking application designed to enhance user productivity and motivation. The core functionality of StudyCafe allows registered users to set study goals with specific durations and receive rewards, such as a virtual coffee, upon completion. By integrating gamification elements, the application seeks to make the study process more engaging and enjoyable.
